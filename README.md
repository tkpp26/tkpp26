## Hey there! I'm Shizuka, a 3rd-year CS student @ UC Irvine.

Recently, Iâ€™ve been working on a [Clothing Recommendation web app](https://github.com/khmorad/clothingRecommendationApp) that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze user-uploaded images and recommend similar clothing items. Currently, I am learning to implement image segmentation and masking techniques to improve the app's ability to handle various backgrounds. In addition to this, Iâ€™m developing a music recommendation app where I aim to analyze audio spectrograms and integrate this with CSV data from Kaggle to enhance the recommendation accuracy.

ðŸŒ¸ðŸ’« I'd love to chat, so feel free to shoot me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shizukatakao/)
